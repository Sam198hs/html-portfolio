<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I am a project manager in the book publishing industry with over three years of experience, during which I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from editorial to marketing and distribution. Throughout my career, I've developed a deep love for learning and constantly seek ways to improve and expand my skill set.</p>

  <p>Recently, I've ventured into web development, driven by a desire to explore the intersection of technology and creativity. I've been learning various web development tools and frame works, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. My goal is to continue developing my skills in this area and eventually integrate web development with my background in project management to create innovative solutions that enhance the publishing process. I'm excited to take this journey forward and apply my growing knowledge in real-world projects.</p>
